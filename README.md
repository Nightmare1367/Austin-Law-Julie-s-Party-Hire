Austin Law
Julie's Party Hire Program

This version will allow the user to append their details
and after appending their details, they will be able to print
the information they appended under the section where the 
labels, entry boxes and buttons are located. The user will be 
unable to delete their row as there is no function that deletes
the users row when they click delete row.
