Julie's Party Hire (Checking Validity)

This version checks if there are any empty entry boxes
or if there are numbers or letters in the wrong entry 
box. If the code detects empty entry boxes, the program 
will show a message saying "Required" next to the empty
entry box. If the code detects numbers or letters in the
wrong entry box, then the program will show a message saying
"Can't have letters" or "Can't have numbers" next to the 
entry box which detected the error.
