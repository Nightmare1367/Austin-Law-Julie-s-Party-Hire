Julie's Party Hire (Main Function) Program

This version of the program will set up Tkinter and create a window
for the user to input their information. Since I created a function
which has the labels, entry boxes and buttons and gridded them, when
I run the program, the labels will appear in their places hence the 
user can interact with the entry boxes and buttons but nothing will
happen if they click the buttons as no command has been set for each
button.
