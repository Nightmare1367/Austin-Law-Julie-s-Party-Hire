Julie's Party Hire (Delete Row)

This version will allow the user to delete the row that the user inputted 
into the row entry box. There are also conditions in place which will stop 
the program from giving an error, this condition checks if the entry box
has any input or if the range for the row number is larger than the amount 
of rows present, then the text for the delete row button will turn red.
